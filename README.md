This webservice is an example of how to attach a chat transcript to an activity in Salesforce.  Chat logs have to be uploaded as attachments because Salesforce has a size limit of 255 characters for text fields.  The UploadChatTranscript handler can be called from ObjectDisconnectMonitor and will send the call id and the recording id to the c# web service.  The web service will lookup the associated Task, download the transcript from recorder and attach it to the Task.

The UploadChatTranscript handler needs to be modified slightly.  The SOAP Http Request Ex toolstep will need to change to point to the url where this web service is hosted.
